2. Download OpenCV 3.0 via https://opencv.org/releases.html
3. Open and Extract OPENCV 3.0 somewhere and remember where the installation is for later.
4. Find the OpenCV_java331.dll inside your opencv installation (ex. "opencvinstalllocation"\opencv\build\java\x64 and copy/paste it into your windows/system32 folder. This is so the jvm can locate the opencv library for the approriate tasks.
